#RIZZLANG

rizzlang is a jit compiled language, using tcc as the compiler.


keep in mind the code is a complete joke, and frankly, this was probably made because i was tired and bored lol.



the original rizzlang interpreter is included, its just a fork and fix of https://gist.github.com/pmachapman/661f0fff9814231fde48
the original compiler is included aswell, i wrote it, and yes im aware that the code quality is really bad.  i was tired.
